#AI-Powered Mining Safety & Risk Prediction System

MineGuard is a machine-learning based safety monitoring system designed to predict risk levels in mining operations using sensor and environmental data. 
It helps mine operators take early preventive actions to avoid accidents and equipment failures.

🚀# Features
- Predicts mine risk level using trained ML model
- Processes sensor data such as gas, temperature, pressure, etc.
- REST API for real-time predictions
- Clean modular backend using Python & ML

🧠# How It Works
- Mining sensor data is collected
- Data is sent to the ML API
- The trained Random Forest model predicts risk level
- System returns Safe / Warning / Danger classification

🛠️# Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas & NumPy
-Flask / FastAPI
- Git & GitHub
